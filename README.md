# Heart_Disease_prediction
This one is a mini Project on Heart disease prediction by using Machine learning Model.
 
# Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters using a machine learning model. The application is built using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for predictions.

# Features
User-friendly web interface using Streamlit
Input fields for relevant medical attributes (e.g., age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc.)
Predictive model trained on a heart disease dataset
Real-time prediction with visualization support

# Tech Stack
Python (Primary language)
Streamlit (For UI development)
Scikit-learn (For machine learning model)
Pandas & NumPy (For data processing)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (For data visualization)

# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction

# Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Run the Streamlit application with the following command:
streamlit run app.py

This will start a local server, and the app can be accessed via the URL displayed in the terminal.

# Dataset
The model is trained using a publicly available heart disease dataset. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health-related attributes.

# Machine Learning Model
The model is trained using logistic regression (or another suitable algorithm).
The dataset is preprocessed using feature scaling and missing value handling.
The performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
